Galvanize WDI second quarter project

branch: seedsnpages

## *Summary:*

### 1. Created new seeds containing a decent number of entries. 
All tables containing foreign keys obey constraints;
we should be able to run all route handlers (that work..).

### 2. New pages: favorites.html, login.html, signup.html. 
These aren’t linked to one another in any way; user can’t click 
link on index to get to signup or log in. But...

### 3. Login.html and signup.html work. 
User can log in, log out and create new account.

### 4. Nav.js works.
If user is logged in, nav shows log out. If not logged in,
shows log in and sign up.

### 5. Favorites.html and favorites.js are there as templates.
They show how to query database and fetch data, which should be 
useful.

### 6. New files:
* /css/styles.css (for new pages)
* /js/favorites.js
* /js/login.js
* /js/nav.js
* /js/signup.js
* /favorites.html
* /login.html
* /signup.html

### 7. Changes
* Made a few alterations to body of index.HTML (all commented out).
* Added gsap animation js file at line 66
