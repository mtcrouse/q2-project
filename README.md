# Twitter Fever
## By Metta Crouse and Samuel Kurland

Twitter Fever, made for the second quarter project of Galvanize's web development immersive
program, generates a Twitter heat map in real time. Users can also search for tweets
of a specific topic and create accounts to save their favorite tweets. The project
uses the Twitter API, the Google Maps API, Node.js, Express, Heatmaps.js, Socket.io, Natural,
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Materialize.
